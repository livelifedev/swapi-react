Deployed: https://next-swapi.herokuapp.com/

This React app was created using Next.js.
To setup:

- clone repo
- npm install
- npm run dev

Other packages used are:

- isomorphic-unfetch (used to fetch data from API)
- styled-jsx (preloaded with Next.js, styling using scoped CSS for components)
- The Star Wars API (SWAPI) from https://swapi.co/

Things to improve:

- Styling still WIP
- Error handling when accessing non-existing endpoint
- Optimize API calls when fetching film data
